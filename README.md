# Lizzie - Leela Zero Interface

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/featurecat/lizzie/master/screenshot0.7.jpg?raw=true)

Lizzie is a graphical interface allowing the user to analyze games in
real time using [Leela Zero](https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero). You
need Java 8 or higher to run this program.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie/wiki) for learning more.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/featurecat/lizzie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/featurecat/lizzie?branch=master)


## Running a release

Just follow the instructions in the provided readme in the
[release](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie/releases/tag/0.7.4).

The first run may take a while because Leela Zero needs to set up the
OpenCL tunings. Just hang tight, and wait for it to finish, then you
will see Leela Zero's analysis displayed on the board. Feel free to supply
your own tunings, as this will speed up the process. Do this by copying
any `leelaz_opencl_tuning` file you have into the directory.

## Building from source

### Building Leela Zero

First, you will need to have a version of Leela Zero that
continually outputs pondering information. You can get this from one
of the Lizzie releases or build it yourself; just compile from the **next**
branch of Leela Zero (see http://github.com/gcp/leela-zero/tree/next for more
details).

    $ git clone --recursive --branch next http://github.com/gcp/leela-zero.git

### Building Lizzie

The simplest way to build Lizzie is to use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

To build the code and package it:

    $ mvn package

### Running Lizzie

    $ java -jar "target/lizzie-0.7-shaded.jar"

(or whatever the current version of the shaded `jar` file is in
`target/`).

After you run this command you should see a GUI start. Lizzie will also start a Leela Zero
process that it will communicate with. You can configure the location of Leela Zero from the
`config.txt` file from the folder you started the `java` command. If Lizzie is unable to start
Leela Zero it will display an error and you can fiddle with the `config.txt` file
until you get all the paths correct.

Lizzie will provide multitude of options to load and save SGF files, run an auto analysis and
configure the board. To see all the options just hold down the key **x** (yes, just press and hold
the letter **x**) and you will see all the commands listed in the GUI.
